## Installing Hestia Control Panel

- **NOTE:** You must install Hestia Control Panel on top of a fresh operating system installation to ensure proper functionality.

While we have taken every effort to make the installation process and the control panel interface as friendly as possible (even for new users), it is assumed that you will have some prior knowledge and understanding in the basics how to set up a Linux server before continuing.

### Step 1: Log in

To start the installation, you will need to be logged in as **root** or a user with super-user privileges. You can perform the installation either directly from the command line console or remotely via SSH:

```bash
ssh root@your.server
```

### Step 2: Download

Download the installation script for the latest release:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/release/install/hst-install.sh
```

If the download fails due to an SSL validation error, please be sure you've installed the ca-certificate package on your system - you can do this with the following command:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install ca-certificates
```

### Step 3: Run

To begin the installation process, simply run the script and follow the on-screen prompts:

```bash
bash hst-install.sh
```

You will receive a welcome email at the address specified during installation (if applicable) and on-screen instructions after the installation is completed to log in and access your server.

### Custom installation

You may specify a number of various flags during installation to only install the features in which you need. To view a list of available options, run:

```bash
bash hst-install.sh -h
```

Alternatively, You can use <https://hestiacp.com/install.html> which allows you to easily generate the installation command via GUI.

## How to upgrade an existing installation

Automatic Updates are enabled by default on new installations of Hestia Control Panel and can be managed from **Server Settings > Updates**. To manually check for and install available updates, use the apt package manager:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
```
