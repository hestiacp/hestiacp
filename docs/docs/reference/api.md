## Upgrading from username/password authentication to access/secret keys

Replace the following code:

```php
// Prepare POST query
$postvars = [
	"user" => $hst_username,
	"password" => $hst_password,
	"returncode" => $hst_returncode,
	"cmd" => $hst_command,
	"arg1" => $username,
];
```

With the following:

```php
// Prepare POST query
$postvars = [
	"hash" => "access_code:secret_code",
	"returncode" => $hst_returncode,
	"cmd" => $hst_command,
	"arg1" => $username,
];
```
