## IMAP specific settings
##

# If nothing happens for this long while client is IDLEing, move the connection
# to imap-hibernate process and close the old imap process. This saves memory,
# because connections use very little memory in imap-hibernate process. The
# downside is that recreating the imap process back uses some resources.
#imap_hibernate_timeout = 0

# Maximum IMAP command line length. Some clients generate very long command
# lines with huge mailboxes, so you may need to raise this if you get
# "Too long argument" or "IMAP command line too large" errors often.
#imap_max_line_length = 64k

# IMAP logout format string:
#  %{input} - total number of bytes read from client
#  %{output} - total number of bytes sent to client
#  %{fetch_hdr_count} - Number of mails with mail header data sent to client
#  %{fetch_hdr_bytes} - Number of bytes with mail header data sent to client
#  %{fetch_body_count} - Number of mails with mail body data sent to client
#  %{fetch_body_bytes} - Number of bytes with mail body data sent to client
#  %{deleted} - Number of mails where client added \Deleted flag
#  %{expunged} - Number of mails that client expunged, which does not
#                include automatically expunged mails
#  %{autoexpunged} - Number of mails that were automatically expunged after
#                    client disconnected
#  %{trashed} - Number of mails that client copied/moved to the
#               special_use=\Trash mailbox.
#  %{appended} - Number of mails saved during the session
#imap_logout_format = in=%i out=%o deleted=%{deleted} expunged=%{expunged} \

# Amend or override the IMAP capability response. To override, set the value
# with imap_capability = 
# 
# To amend, you can use a boolean list to specify which capabilities to turn
# on and off
#imap_capability {
#  SPECIAL-USE = yes
#  "LITERAL+" = no
#}

# How long to wait between "OK Still here" notifications when client is
# IDLEing.
#imap_idle_notify_interval = 2 mins

# ID field names and values to send to clients. Using * as the value makes
# Dovecot use the default value. The following fields have default values
# currently: name, version, os, os-version, support-url, support-email,
# revision.
#imap_id_send = 

# Use imap_id_received event to log IMAP id

# Workarounds for various client bugs:
#   delay-newmail:
#     Send EXISTS/RECENT new mail notifications only when replying to NOOP
#     and CHECK commands. Some clients ignore them otherwise, for example OSX
#     Mail (<v2.1). Outlook Express breaks more badly though, without this it
#     may show user "Message no longer in server" errors. Note that OE6 still
#     breaks even with this workaround if synchronization is set to
#     "Headers Only".
#   tb-extra-mailbox-sep:
#     Thunderbird gets somehow confused with LAYOUT=fs (mbox and dbox) and
#     adds extra '/' suffixes to mailbox names. This option causes Dovecot to
#     ignore the extra '/' instead of treating it as invalid mailbox name.
#   tb-lsub-flags:
#     Show \Noselect flags for LSUB replies with LAYOUT=fs (e.g. mbox).
#     This makes Thunderbird realize they aren't selectable and show them
#     greyed out, instead of only later giving "not selectable" popup error.
#
# This is a boolean list
#imap_client_workarounds {
#  delay-newmail = yes
#}

# Host allowed in URLAUTH URLs sent by client. "*" allows all.
#imap_urlauth_host =

# Enable IMAP LITERAL- extension (replaces LITERAL+)
#imap_literal_minus = no

# What happens when FETCH fails due to some internal error:
#   disconnect-immediately:
#     The FETCH is aborted immediately and the IMAP client is disconnected.
#   disconnect-after:
#     The FETCH runs for all the requested mails returning as much data as
#     possible. The client is finally disconnected without a tagged reply.
#   no-after:
#     Same as disconnect-after, but tagged NO reply is sent instead of
#     disconnecting the client. If the client attempts to FETCH the same failed
#     mail more than once, the client is disconnected. This is to avoid clients
#     from going into infinite loops trying to FETCH a broken mail.
#imap_fetch_failure = disconnect-immediately
