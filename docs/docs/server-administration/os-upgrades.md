# Operating system upgrades

::: danger
Before upgrading your operating system make sure to make a backup! We do not provide support for broken operating system installations. We only provide this page for information about Hestia issues that may come up while upgrading.
:::

## General

::: info
Make sure to verify that MariaDB is running on a supported version for the new operating system. If that is not the case, update MariaDB version to a supported version before upgrading your OS!
:::

Once a backup has been made, update Hestia to the last supported version:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade
```

Follow system instructions to upgrade your OS. When done, make sure to check that the files in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` are not hashed out. If they are, remove the hash and run `apt update && apt upgrade` again.
