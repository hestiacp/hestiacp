# SC2086 = SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting. - Keep it more readable please use them with v-xxx-commands when used user input might be not validated corrections and  whitespaces might cause a risk
#  SC2002: Useless cat. Consider 'cmd < file | ..' or 'cmd file | ..' instead.
# Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with $?. Might be worth disable in in the future
# SC2181: Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with $?.
# SC2153: Possible misspelling: DOMAIN may not be assigned, but domain is. - Issues with SOURCE importing vars that are not defined in the script it self but config files
# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes, use double quotes for that. - History reasons
# SC2196: egrep is non-standard and deprecated. Use grep -E instead. Todo be removed in the future
# SC1090; Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location. - DevIT loves $DevIT/data/ips/$ip
# SC2031: var was modified in a subshell. That change might be lost.
