# Best Practices

Managing a server is not easy. Here are some best practices you should try to adhere to while managing your Hestia server.

## Use a regular user

Before adding any web or mail domain on your server, you should create a regular user. To do this, you can refer to our [User Management Guide](../user-guide/users#adding-a-user).

## Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for the _admin_ user

Since the **admin** user has full control on the server, as well as elevated privileges, it is **greatly** recommended that you enable 2FA on this account. To do this, you can refer to our [Account Management](../user-guide/account#two-factor-authentication-2fa).
