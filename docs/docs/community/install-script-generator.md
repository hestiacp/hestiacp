# Install script generator

These are some install script generators created by the community:

- [DevITcp-scriptline-generator](https://github.com/gabizz/DevITcp-scriptline-generator)

- [DevITCP-Command-Creator](https://github.com/turbopixel/DevITCP-Command-Creator)

We thank the community for these contributions, which our [official install script generator](/install) is inspired by.
