.js and .php files placed in this directory will automatically be included in scripts loading init.js.

subfolders will be ignored (recursive file loading is not supported. you're free to create sub-folders, but they will not be invoked automatically.)

These custom files will persist across DevCP upgrades.

This directory is not meant for DevCP development, but meant for people wanting to customize their own DevCP control panel.

Warning: modifications to this README.txt may be lost during DevCP upgrades.
